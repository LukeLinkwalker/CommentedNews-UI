# CommentedNews-UI

This is the UI part of a broader project. The purpose of the broader project is the gather all news articles posted to /r/Denmark throughout the day and rank them by number of comments they receive. The purpose of this is to make it easy to see which news might be relevant to read based on the user interaction that they are getting.

This UI is made with Blazor + Bootstrap and gets the required data by making a HTTP request to the API function defined in [CommentedNews-Functions](https://github.com/LukeLinkwalker/CommentedNews-Functions).
This UI is also automatically deployed to the Azure Cloud.
